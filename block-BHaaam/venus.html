              <p> Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the night
                  sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[15][16] Venus lies within Earth's 
                  orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits 
                  the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar
                  System and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east).[18] Venus does not have any moons, a 
                  distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.
                  Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. 
                  It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. 
                  The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus has by far the hottest
                  surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of 
                  highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[20][21] but these would have 
                  vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect.[22] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the
                  solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.[23] Venus' surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.</p>
              
             <h2> Physical characteristics</h2>
             <p>  Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass, and is often described as Earth's "sister" or "twin".
                  The diameter of Venus is 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because 
                  its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen</p>

            <h1>Facts of Venus</h1>
            <img src="venus2.jpg" alt="loading error" width="300px" height="200px">
            <p> alileo saw Venus through a telescope and determined it had phases similar to the Moon. This helped support the Copernican view that planets orbited the Sun and not vice versa as previously believed.
                Since Venus is the brightest object in the sky after the Moon, and the Sun, it was given the name of the Roman goddess of beauty and love, the ancient Greek’s named it Aphrodite.
                In ancient times, Venus was taught as being two different objects in the sky: The Mourning Star and The Evening Star. In Mercury’s case, it was also mistakenly believed to be two different things.
                It is the only planet named after a female deity and it is the brightest planet in the Solar System.
                Though it can easily be seen, its surface is hidden by thick clouds thus it was for a long time believed that it was similar to Earth.
                When its surface was observed, it was determined that in fact its clouds were made up of sulfuric acid and water vapor, but more importantly, it’s temperature was measured,
                 having an average of 465 degrees Celsius, 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead.</p>
