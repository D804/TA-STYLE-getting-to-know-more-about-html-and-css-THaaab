              <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: pinyin
                 also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear
                 native to south central China. It is characterised by black 
                 patches around its eyes,</p>

                 The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it
                 a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order 
                 Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and

                 occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat
                 rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive       
                 honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas
                 along with specially prepared food</p>

              <h2>Birds</h2>
              
              <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class
                 Aves, characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of
                 hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate,</p>


              <p> a four-chambered heart, and a
                  strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size
                  from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich.
                  There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are
                  passerine, or "perching" birds.</p>

               <p>Birds have wings whose development varies
                  according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct
                  moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the
                  ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds
                  including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive.</p>
